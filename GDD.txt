* Player *

Spells:

 * There can only be ONE attack spell, ONE defensive spell, and ONE healing spell
 * The effectiveness of spells are dependent on the Players level in SPELLS
 * Attack and defensive spells have longer periods of cooldown or larger mana
 * IDEA: Each spell should have a positive effect and a negative effect, encouraging use of spells in certain areas vs. others.

	- LIFE DRAINING -
